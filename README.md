# Data Science Final Project

This repo holds the deliverables for my Data Science (CSCI 303)
final project. I performed dimensionality reduction of human faces,
enabling images of human faces to be represented with only 128 features.
I also used the latent representation to generate and modify images of
human faces.

The python notebook contains the code used for the project.

The pdf contains the final written report, which contains all results.

The mp4 contains the final presentation, which is a distilled version
of the written report.
